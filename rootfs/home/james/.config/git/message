# When applied, this commit will…


# Why was this change needed?

# Any references to tickets, issues, articles, etc?

# Any co-author?

#
# DOCUMENTATION
#
# The second line, which is the title of your commit, should be limited to 50
# characters in length because it also becomes the subject line of your email
# when using git send-email — and lots of text like "[PATCH linux-usb v2 0/13]"
# can get added to beginning. By the way, since this is a title, do not use a
# sentence-ending period.
#
# The fifth line forward, which is where the body of your commit start, should
# be hard-wrapped at 72 columns because that is the standard width of an email,
# and email is an important tool for git.
#
# Wrapping your lines like might be annoying, and burdensome, but consider that
# when working with others, they may not be reading the commit log in the same
# context as you. The open source community is made of people with all sorts of
# hardware, and they might not be able to cram as much text into one line as
# your 4K 16:9 display can.
#
#          Format
#
# When adding references, and co-authors to the commit body message, the
# following format should be used.
#
# For references, tickets, issues, and whatnot:
#   * See: https://example.tld/path/to/article/
#   * Fix: #1
#
# For co-authors:
#   * Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.tld>
#
#          Credits
