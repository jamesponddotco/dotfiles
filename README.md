# `dotfiles`

This repository holds a collection of configuration files for my
workstations and servers.

![Screenshot of a several applications showing the consistency of the
color scheme.](screenshot.png)

As far as looks goes, imagine [GNOME Shell](https://www.gnome.org/) and
[Sway](https://swaywm.org/) had a baby. I try to stick to the
[Adwaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language)) color
scheme for consistency, but it's not always possible to do so.

## Contributing

While these are personal configuration files, anyone can help make them
better. I'm particularly interested in more configuration files that
make more applications follow the Adwaita color scheme.
